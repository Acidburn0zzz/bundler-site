  Rails 3 comes with baked in support with bundler.

%h2 Using Bundler with Rails 3

%p
  Install Rails as you normally would. Use sudo if you would normally use sudo
  to install gems.
:code
  $ gem install rails
.notes
  We recommend using rvm for dependable Ruby installations, especially if you
  are switching between different versions of Ruby

%p
  Generate a Rails app as usual
:code
  $ rails new myapp
  $ cd myapp

%p
  Run the server. Bundler is transparently managing
  your dependencies!
:code
  $ rails server

%p
  Add new dependencies to your Gemfile as you
  need them.
:code
  # lang: ruby
  gem 'nokogiri'
  gem 'geokit'

%p
  If you want a dependency to be loaded only in
  a certain Rails environment, place it in a group
  named after that Rails environment
:code
  # lang: ruby
  group :test do
    gem 'rspec'
    gem 'faker'
  end

%p#shared-with-23
  You can place a dependency in multiple groups at once as well:
:code
  # lang: ruby
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'wirble'
    gem 'ruby-debug'
  end
= link_to 'Learn More: Groups', './groups.html'

%p
  After adding a dependency, if it is not yet installed, install it:
:code
  $ bundle install
.notes
  This will update all dependencies in your Gemfile to the latest versions that
  do not conflict with other dependencies
